Hey you found me! This is my first blog post on a site I have been rewriting over and over again without committing to for a couple years now. Well in 2022 I intend to change that - my resolutions this year are focused on contributions:

1. Contribute more to this site (mostly blog posts)
2. Contribute to my local computer science community
3. Contribute to more open source projects

Below are some topics I'd like to focus on going forward:

## Software and Software management

My full time gig is in software engineering, specifically I am currently working as a Software Engineering Manager.  My primary focus is on frontend, so most of my posts going forward will be explaining frontend concepts or describing the learning process when I decide to branch out.

This page was built using ReactJS, with blog posts written in markdown and converted to JSX. I might go into more detail in the future on the construction since I found that other examples were either too complex for my liking or relied too heavily on libraries.

## Photograhy

I'm an avid photographer and traveler.  My initial intent for this blog was primarily photo based, but as I started to lead engineering teams I realized how much I enjoy teaching and talking tech, so instead I'll just make the blog about things I like in general, including photography (and of course photography gear)

## Woodworking/DIY

The honey-do list is long and it grow, grows, grows... Just kidding (sorta) but I also love woodworking and building new things/furniture in our home. I might even do a retroactive post or two on some of our home renovations because Instagram loved the before/after - might as well steal it.

## Thanks

You made it to the end - thanks!  I hope to provide some more elaborate posts soon.  2022 here we come!
